International studies show that many more people have difficulties understanding serious information from public authorities or companies. In this presentation we will introduce rules and criteria for easy-to-understand language and show some good examples from companies and public authorities. Since most people who are responsible for writing and providing information do not know how to write easy-to-understand texts, AI-based writing assistance can be very useful. In the talk, we will show how we can analyze and simplify complicated information very easily with an AI-based writing assistance.\nBio: Walburga Fröhlich is Co-Founder and CEO of capito. For 30 years, she has been concerned with the question of how the potential of disabled people can be made visible and developed in our society and what accessible communication does for our society. Together with her team, she has developed AI-based digital tools for easier comprehensible information. Walburga was born in 1966 in Austria, she studied first social work and has in addition a Masters degree in Social Management. She has already received many awards for her work, including the European Woman Innovator Prize or the European Innovation Council “Seal for Excellence”.\ncapito is the leading provider of information in easy-to-understand language. Both analog and digital thanks to artificial intelligence. For over 24 years, experts at capito have been simplifying texts into easily understandable language levels. All simplifications are carried out based on the capito criteria catalog.\nWith capito.ai, this long-standing expertise has been successfully digitalized. capito.ai is a tool that uses artificial intelligence to simplify texts. It analyses the comprehensibility of texts, makes suggestions for simplification, and simplifies texts fully automatically in 3 language levels.\n","date":1731628800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1731628800,"objectID":"f1b148afef8dfb47b6227132ac489693","permalink":"https://genairiskworkshop.github.io/talks/frohlich/","publishdate":"2024-09-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talks/frohlich/","section":"talks","summary":"Easy-to-understand language is not only needed by people with learning difficulties and disabilities.
